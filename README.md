# Branching Out: Using Decision Trees to Inform Education Decisions'

This repository contains a web guide, R code, and sample data to implement 
the example Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis described 
in [Branching Out: Using Decision Trees to Inform Education Decisions](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/project.asp?projectID=6689).
The code in this repository is based on code from Appendix A of the guide.
This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the web guide)
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images for use in the guide

These materials were originally authored by Neil Seftor for REL Appalachia.
