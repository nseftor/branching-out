# Branching Out: Using Decision Trees to Inform Education Decisions'

This repository contains a web guide, R code, and sample data to implement 
the example Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis described 
in [Branching Out: Using Decision Trees to Inform Education Decisions](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/project.asp?projectID=6689).

Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is a statistical modeling 
approach that uses quantitative data to predict future outcomes for current 
students. Educators can use results from CART analyses to identify students 
who are most likely to benefit from additional support early—in the months 
and years before problems fully materialize. The guide introduces CART 
analysis as an approach that allows data analysts to generate actionable 
analytic results that can inform educators’ decisions about the allocation 
of extra supports for students. Data analysts with intermediate statistical 
software programming experience can use the guide to learn how to conduct a 
CART analysis and support research directors in local and state education 
agencies and other educators in applying the results. Research directors 
can use the guide to learn how results of CART analysis can inform education 
decisions.

The code in this repository is based on code from Appendix A of the guide.
This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the web guide)
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images for use in the guide
